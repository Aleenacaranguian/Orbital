Orbital 2025 - Milestone 1

Team Name: 
PawPals 

Proposed Level of Achievement: 
Project Gemini 

MOTIVATION
As dog owners, we struggle to find a trustable platform to book capable dog caretakers to take care of our pets within our budget—especially when we are overseas or during busy work periods. PawPals offers the perfect solution by connecting pet owners with trusted caretakers who can meet their pets' specific needs.

Beyond just a service, PawPals fosters a community. It acts as a forum and blog platform where pet owners can connect with others who share similar experiences, ask questions, 
and exchange advice on pet care. 
AIM 
PawPal’s goal is to bridge the gap between pet owners and reliable pet sitters while fostering an inclusive and supportive pet-caretaking community. Our platform will provide a secure and user-friendly system for pet care services. It offers customisable service matching based on pet needs, budget and caretaker expertise and a varied network of pet sitters with reviews, ratings. Furthermore, it serves as a forum and blog where pet owners can share their experiences and seek advice.


USER STORIES
As a pet owner of a dog and a fish going on a 7-day trip, I want a reliable and highly experienced pet-sitter who can take care of my dog and fish in a new environment, and provide regular updates so I am reassured that both my pets are in good hands.
As a pet owner on a tight budget who wants my dog walked on days when I work overtime, I want an accessible platform to find someone to walk my dog on short notice and within my budget.
As a new pet owner with no experience who wants to learn how to care for my cat, I want a platform where I can ask experienced pet owners questions and receive insightful advice.

UNIQUE SELLING POINT
Support for a Wider Range of Pets
The application extends support to pets beyond just dogs and cats — including fish, rabbits, birds and more, with sitters capable of catering to their different unique care needs.

Real-Time Updates 
Sitters can message owners while the pets are in their care to provide reassurance to their owners. This allows owners to still feel connected to their pets.

Community
Our community page allows pet owners and sitters to connect, share advice and support.
